     We love to think of Bethlehem,
             That little mountain town,
       To which, on earth's first Christmas Day,
             Our blessed Lord came down.
       A lowly manger for His bed,
             The cattle near in stall,
       There, cradled close in Mary's arms,
             He slept, the Lord of all.

     If we had been in Bethlehem,
             We too had hasted fain
       To see the Babe whose little face
             Knew neither care nor pain.
       Like any little child of ours,
             He came unto His own,
       Through Cross and shame before Him stretched,--
             His pathway to His Throne.

     If we had dwelt in Bethlehem,
             We would have followed fast,
       And where the Star had led our feet
             Have knelt ere dawn was past.
       Our gifts, our songs, our prayers had been
             An offering, as He lay,
       The blessed Babe of Bethlehem,
             In Mary's arms that day.

     Now breaks the latest Christmas Morn!
             Again the angels sing,
       And far and near the children throng
             Their happy hymns to bring.
       All heaven is stirred! All earth is glad!
             For down the shining way,
       The Lord who came to Bethlehem,
             Comes yet, on Christmas Day.
